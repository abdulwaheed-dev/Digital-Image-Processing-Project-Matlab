# Digital-Image-Processing-Project-Matlab

### Semester Project for subject Digital Image Processing
1. GUI Based project
2. Build in Matlab
3. Five Tasks for Digital Image Processing

### Filters and techniques used in this project are:

**1. Median filter**
- reducing salt-and-pepper noise
- window slides along the image
- median intensity value of the pixels within the window becomes the output intensity of the pixel being processed.


**2. Average filtering** 

- smoothing images by reducing the amount of intensity variation between neighbouring pixels.
- move through the image pixel by pixel
- replacing each value with the average value of neighbouring pixels.

**3. Wiener Filtering**

- image restoration tech
- blurness remove
- noise if present considered as gaussian, then remove

**4. Arithmetic Mean Filter** 

- It is defined as the average of all pixels within a local region of an image. 
- The larger the filtering mask becomes the more predominant the blurring becomes and less high spatial frequency detail that remains in the image.

**5. Geometric mean Filter**

- the color value of each pixel is replaced with the geometric mean of color values of the pixels in a surrounding region. A larger region (filter size) yields a stronger filter effect with the drawback of some blurring. ... The geometric mean filter is very susceptible to negative outliers.

**6. Histogram Equalization**

- Histogram Equalization is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in images. ... This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.

**7. Median filtering**

- Median filtering is a nonlinear process useful in reducing impulsive, or salt-and-pepper noise. ... In a median filter, a window slides along the image, and the median intensity value of the pixels within the window becomes the output intensity of the pixel being processed.

**8. ADAPTIVE MEDIAN FILTER**

- The adaptive median filter is designed to eliminate the drawbacks faced by the standard median. The main advantage of adaptive median filter is the size of the kernel surrounding the corrupted image is variable due to which better output result is obtained.
